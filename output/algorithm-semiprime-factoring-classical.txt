Now factoring the semiprime number 15.
The precision needed is 4 bits.
The periods detected are [4].
The decided factors are [3,5].
3 * 5 = 15


Now factoring the semiprime number 21.
The precision needed is 4 bits.
The periods detected are [6].
The decided factors are [7,3].
7 * 3 = 21


Now factoring the semiprime number 51.
The precision needed is 4 bits.
The periods detected are [8].
The decided factors are [3,17].
3 * 17 = 51
