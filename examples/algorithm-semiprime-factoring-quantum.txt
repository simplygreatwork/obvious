- while converting this example
	- hard code the expansion of a^x for now
	 until the entire circuit works for 15 and 21

- quantum results and candidates for for semiprime 15

	```
	QPU read result: 16
	Repeat period candidates: 4,8,12,16,20,24,28,32,36,40,44
	```
	
- quantum results and candidates for for semiprime 21
	
	```
	QPU read result: 36
	Repeat period candidates: 2,5,7,9,16,32
	```
