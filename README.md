## A tiny, hackable, optimized quantum computing simulator

- Currently based on a compacted version of:
	- https://github.com/quantastica/quantum-circuit
- Other engines have been based on: 
	- https://github.com/adamisntdead/qics
	- https://github.com/qcsimulator/qcsimulator.github.io

## Features

- A small, hackable, inspectable library for learning quantum computing.
- Trace gate operations to display state changes as gates are applied.
- Prints amplitude, probability, and phase.
- Reasonably performant for 10 - 20 qubits using the quantastica engine.
